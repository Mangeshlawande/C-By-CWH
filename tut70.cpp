// Containers in stl

/*
containers
1. sequence container =>store data in linear fashion  (vector, list,double ended queue  )
1. vector -(Random access fastand insertion/deletion in middle is slow ), insertion at end is fast .
2. List -(RA = slow , M- insertion =fastas compared to array), eg.linked list.

2. Associative container => for faster access of data, direct access of an element (Map , Multimap and Dictionary), 
tree like structure i. set / multiset 
                    ii. map/ multimap 
                    -can't make random access 
                    -All operation is fast Except Random access

                    
3. Derived container => form sequence container , Real world modeling (d-queue, stack(LIFO Push, Pop), queue(FIFO ) ,P-queue)
 -Depends on data structures
