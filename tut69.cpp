//The C++ standard Template Library(STL) |
/*
A good idea not to reinvent the wheel ;
competitive Programming 
1. Limited Time => Resizing , sorting , searching 
STL(standard Template Library) => Library of generic classes and functions,
Q1. Why use STL ? => Reuse well tested Component (classes and functions);
=> Save's Time 
History => Alexender , Mengly combine some conponents & build a Lib of classes and functions  for reusing functions 
components of stl =>
container, algorithms and iterators.
container =>store some data(vector) use template classes 
Algorithms => set of procedures which manipulate(Process) data to reach some result;(sorting , searching, merging, etc.,)use template function 
Iterators => An object that points to an element in a container,Handles just like pointers , contain Algorithm with container.
STL = Container + Algorithms + Iterator
